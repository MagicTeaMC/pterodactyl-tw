# Yarn deduplicate

Cleans up `yarn.lock` by removing duplicates.

A duplicate package is when two dependencies are resolved to a different version, even when a single
version matches the range specified in the dependencies. See the [Deduplication
strategies](#deduplication-strategies) section for a few examples.

## Installation

Install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g yarn-deduplicate
```

or

```bash
yarn global add yarn-deduplicate
```

This package also works wth [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b),
so you don't need to install it.

## Usage

The most common scenario is to run

```bash
yarn-deduplicate yarn.lock
```

This will use the default strategy to remove duplicated packages in `yarn.lock`.

If you do not specify the yarn.lock path, it defaults to `yarn.lock`.

Check all available options with:

```bash
yarn-deduplicate --help
```

## Duplicated packages

`yarn.lock` contains a list of all the dependencies required by your project (including transitive
dependencies), and the actual package version installed to satistfy those dependencies.

For the context of this project, a "duplicated package" is a package that appers on multiple nodes
of the dependency tree with overlapping version ranges but resolved to different versions.

For example, imagine that your project directly depends on `lodash` and `babel`, and `babel` depends
on `lodash` as well. Specifically, your project depends on `lodash@^1.0.0` and `babel` depends on
`lodash@^1.1.0`. Because how the resolution algorithm works in Yarn, you might end up with two
different copies of `lodash` (for example, version `1.0.1` and `1.2.0`) in your project, even when
`1.2.0` will suffice to satisfy both requirements for `lodash`. That's a "duplicated package".

It is important to note that we do not consider duplicated packages when the version ranges don't
overlap. For example, if your project depends on `underscore@^1.0.0` and `underscore@^2.0.0`. Your
project will end up with two versions of `underscore`, and `yarn-deduplicate` won't change that.

When using `yarn-deduplicate` remember that **it will change your dependency tree**. There are
certain code paths that now will run with a different set of dependencies. It is highly recommended
that you review each change to `yarn.lock`. If the change is too big, use the flag `--packages` to
deduplicate them gradually.

### Deduplication strategies

`highest`
It will try to use the highest installed version. For example, with the following `yarn.lock`:

```
library@^1.1.0:
    version "1.2.0"

library@^1.2.0:
    version "1.2.0"

library@^1.3.0:
    version "1.3.0"
```

It will deduplicate `library@^1.1.0` and `library@^1.2.0` to `1.3.0`

`fewer`
It will try to minimize the number of installed versions by trying to deduplicate to the version
that satisfies most of the ranges first. For example, with the following `yarn.lock`:

```
library@*:
    version "2.0.0"

library@>=1.1.0:
    version "3.0.0"

library@^1.2.0:
    version "1.2.0"
```

It will deduplicate `library@*` and `library@>=1.1.0` to `1.2.0`.

Note that this will cause some packages to **downgrade** it version. Be sure to check the changelogs
between all versions and understand the consequences of that downgrade. If unsure, don't use this
strategy.

It is not recommended to use different strategies for different packages. There is no guarantee that
the strategy will be honored in subsequent runs of `yarn-deduplicate` unless the same set of flags
is specified again.

### Progressive deduplication

`--packages <package1> <package2> <packageN>`

Receives a list of packages to deduplicate. It will ignore any other duplicated package not in the
list. This option is recommended when the number of duplicated packages in `yarn.lock` is too big
to be easily reviewed by a human. This will allow for a more controlled and progressive
deduplication of `yarn.lock`.


## Migration guide

### From 0.x to 1.x

In this version we have renamed the project and refactored the CLI. These are the equivalent
commands:

#### Installation

```bash
# Old
npm install -g yarn-tools

# New
npm install -g yarn-deduplicate
```

#### List duplicates

```bash
# Old
yarn-tools list-duplicates path/to/yarn.lock

# New
yarn-deduplicate --list path/to/yarn.lock
```

### Deduplicate yarn.lock
```bash
# Old
yarn-tools fix-duplicates path/to/yarn.lock > tmp
mv tmp path/to/yarn.lock

# New
yarn-deduplicate path/to/yarn.lock
```


### Limit packages to deduplicate yarn.lock
```bash
# Old
yarn-tools fix-duplicates path/to/yarn.lock package1 package2


# New
yarn-deduplicate --packages package1,package2 path/to/yarn.lock
```
